1Three-Point Estimation (PERT Formula)
The three-point estimation formula used is:

Question 1: Expected Duration Calculation
Estimate	Value (hours)
	
 hours
The expected duration for this task is approximately 8.33 hours.
Question 2: Estimated Task Duration and Weight Explanation
Estimate	Value (hours)
	
 hours
The estimated task duration is approximately 7.67 hours.
Explanation of Weight: The Most Likely Estimate (P) is given more weight (multiplied by 4) because it represents the duration most probable under normal operating conditions, making it the most realistic outcome.

2Gantt Chart Scheduling
Question 1: Project Schedule and Gantt Chart
Task	Duration (Days)	Predecessor	Start Day	End Day
A	2	None	0	2
B	3	A	2	5
C	1	A	2	3
D	4	B	5	9
E	2	B	5	7
The total project
duration is 9 days.
Gantt Chart Representation: 
Question 2: Project Schedule and Total Duration The total project duration is 12 days (Path 1 → 2 → 3).
Gantt Chart Representation: Task 2
Question 3: Gantt Chart Visualization
The total project duration is 10 days (Path X → Y).
Day	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10
Task X										
Task Y										
Task Z										
Gantt Chart Representation:
Gantt Chart Visualization Role: They provide a visual timeline that clearly shows task dependencies and aids in managing project timelines by detailing the schedule, duration, and progress of activities.

3PERT/CPM and Critical Path Calculation
Question 1: AOA Diagram and Critical Path
•Path A → B → D: 4 + 6 + 7 = 17 days
•Path A → C → D: 4 + 5 + 7 = 16 days
The critical path is A-B-D. The total project duration is 17 days.
Question 2: AON Diagram and Critical Path
•Path A → B → D → F: 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 14 days
•Path A → C → E → F: 2 + 3 + 5 + 2 = 12 days
The critical path is A-B-D-F. The total project duration is 14 days.
Question 4: Critical Path and Total Project Duration
•Path A → B → D: 3 + 6 + 4 = 13 days
•Path A → C → D: 3 + 2 + 4 = 9 days
The critical path is A-B-D. The total project duration is 13 days.
Question 5: Critical Path and Total Project Duration
•Path A → B → D → F: 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 = 11 days
•Path A → C → E → F: 2 + 5 + 6 + 2 = 15 days
The critical path is A-C-E-F. The total project duration is 15 days.
Question 6: Earliest/Latest Times and Critical Path The Total Project Duration is 16 days.
Activity	Dur	ES	EF	LS	LF	TS
A	4	0	4	0	4	0
B	7	4	11	4	11	0
C	5	4	9	6	11	2
D	3	11	14	11	14	0
E	2	14	16	14	16	0
The critical path is A-B-D-E.

4Slack Time Calculation
Total Slack (TS) = LS − ES or LF − EF.
Question 7: Slack Time and Critical Path
The Total Project Duration is 11 days.
Activity	Dur	ES	EF	LS	LF	TS	Critical Path?
A	2	0	2	0	2	0	YES
B	3	2	5	3	6	1	NO
C	4	2	6	2	6	0	YES
D	5	6	11	6	11	0	YES
The critical path is A-C-D.
Question 8: Total Slack for Non-Critical Activities The Total Project Duration is 12 days.
Activity	Dur	ES	EF	LS	LF	TS	Zero Slack?
A	1	0	1	0	1	0	YES
B	3	1	4	5	8	4	NO
C	5	1	6	1	6	0	YES
D	4	4	8	8	12	4	NO
E	6	6	12	6	12	0	YES
Zero Slack Activities (Critical Path A-C-E): A, C, E. Total Slack for Non-Critical Activities:
•Activity B: 4 days
•Activity D: 4 days
Question 9: Slack Time and Critical Path
The Total Project Duration is 13 days.
Activity	Dur	ES	EF	LS	LF	TS	Critical Path?
A	2	0	2	0	2	0	YES
B	5	2	7	2	7	0	YES
C	3	2	5	4	7	2	NO
D	4	7	11	7	11	0	YES
E	2	11	13	11	13	0	YES
The activities on the critical path are A, B, D, and E.
Question 10: Slack Time, Critical Path, and Total Duration The Total Project Duration is 18 days.
Activity	Dur	ES	EF	LS	LF	TS	Critical Path?
A	3	0	3	0	3	0	YES
B	4	3	7	3	7	0	YES
C	2	3	5	9	11	6	NO
D	5	7	12	7	12	0	YES
E	3	5	8	12	15	7	NO
F	6	12	18	12	18	0	YES
The critical path is A-B-D-F.
